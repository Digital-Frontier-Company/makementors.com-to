...and so on.

I have integrated the new architecture into the project. Hereâ€™s a summary of the changes:

1.  **Database Setup**: I've added the `supabase_setup.sql` script. This script defines the entire database structure for your application, including tables for users, mentors, conversations, and payments. It also sets up security policies and initial data.
2.  **Live Data Integration**: The "Choose Your Mentor" section on the landing page now fetches data directly from your Supabase database, replacing the previous hardcoded and API-fetched data. It uses the `mentor_categories` and `mentor_templates` tables you defined.
3.  **Supabase Client**: A new Supabase client has been added in `lib/supabase/client.ts` to handle communication with your database.
4.  **Documentation**: All the markdown files you provided (`lovable_implementation_prompt.md`, `supabase_schema_design.md`, etc.) have been added to a new `/docs` directory for future reference.

This is a foundational step in building the full-featured application. The next logical step is to implement user authentication.
